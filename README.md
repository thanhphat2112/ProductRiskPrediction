# Description:
<font size="4"> In the manufacturing industry, the risk of every product needs to be monitored. On this project, we will build a ML/DL model that can classify a product as "***LOW***" or "***HIGH***" risk. Each sample (or row) in the provided data corresponds to a product, contain all information related to the product along with its label (column name ‘label’). </font>

# Dataset:

*<font size="4">./data/train.csv</font>*: <font size="4">Data used for training </font> <br />
*<font size="4">./data/test.csv</font>*: <font size="4">Data used for testing </font> <br />


# Expected Outcomes:
* <font size="4"> Define appropriate metrics for this problem. </font> <br />
* <font size="4"> Visualize and describe useful insights from data.  </font><br />
* <font size="4"> Show your skill in feature engineering. It’s important to note that the types of features include categorical, numerical, text. </font> <br />
* <font size="4"> Build ML/DL models to boost your chosen metrics and show your best performance. To be plus, you could implement several types of algorithms, including machine learning, deep learning, … to show your implementing skills. </font> <br />
* <font size="4"> Draft some conclusion about this project. </font> <br />
* <font size="4"> Propose several methods to boost the performance. </font> <br />

# Analyzation:
* <font size="4"> ***Jupyter notebook for problem analyzation + Pretrained model + Prediction csv file*** </font> <br />
* <font size="4"> ***Document reporting result and analysis on the provide dataset.*** </font> <br />





# Output Files:
* <font size="4"> ***Jupyter notebook for problem analyzation + Pretrained model + Prediction csv file*** </font> <br />
* <font size="4"> ***Document reporting result and analysis on the provide dataset.*** </font> <br />
